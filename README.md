## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Color pallete](documentation/colorpalette.png)
The website uses the scheme to go with the colors of nature in the photography. Jocular green was used as a background color to stay true to the color of nature, and wizard blue as the clear skies as hover effect color on the input fields and submit button, and as response color on the buttons. The color palette was generated through the Coolors website.


### Typography

Fonts used for this site were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
* Lato Google font was used as the primary font for the site for content readability.

  ![Main font](documentation/primaryfont.png)

* Lobster Google font was used as the logo font for it to standout.

  ![Logo font](documentation/logofont.png)

* Abel Google font was also used only for the cover text to give a slight emphasis on the text. 

  ![Accent font](documentation/covertextfont.png)
  
### Imagery

Photos of the trails, camp sites, and views from the trails and atop the summit were used in the website. Some of these photos are personal collections and some are taken from other hikers/photographers on the web, which I included in the [Credits](#credits) section.

### Wireframes

Wireframes are created for all the page sections using Balsamiq.

## Features

### General features

The website only has a single page which is divided into three sections, which are accessible from the navigation menu (About us, Trails and Join us sections). A second page is also added as a response page which is shown once a user correctly fills out and submits the form on the Join Us section.

#### Navigation Bar

The main page has a responsive navigation bar at the top which allows the user to navigate through the site. To the left of the navigation bar is the name of the hikers' group and to the right of the navigation bar are the links to the sections in the page (About us, Trails and Join us). 

![Navbar browser](documentation/navbrowser.png)

When viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change to a burger toggler. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to promote a good user experience, as users are used to seeing the burger icon when on mobile devices to navigate a site.

![Navbar mobile](documentation/navmobile.png)

Once the burger menu is clicked, a dropdown menu will appear with the links.

![Navbar mobile dropdown](documentation/navmobile2.png)

The response page, however, has a different navigation bar. instead of the three sections on the menu, a link Back to Home page is on the right side. It is another option for users to click, if the page is not automatically redirected back to the home page after 10 seconds.  

![Navbar response](documentation/navbarresponse.png)

On mobile devices, the dropdown menu only contains the link Back to Home page.

![Navbar response dropdown](documentation/navbarresponse2.png)

#### Hero Section

This section has a fixed background image which show a view of Mt. Pulag where the group climbs on a regular basis. It also contains a cover text with the tag Mt. Pulag is known for and the address.

#### Footer

Both pages have a footer which contains a qoute from Edmund Hillary and social media icon links to facebook, instagram, youtube and tiktok. Icons were used to keep the footer clean and because they are universally recognisable. For users to be able to contact Mt. Pulag hikers, mobile phone numbers and email address are also shown alongside the social media icons. Icons are also animated on hover.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

1. Using semantic HTML.
2. Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
3. Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text - e.g. social networks.
4. Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
5. Ensuring menus are accessible by fixing it on top of the screen.
